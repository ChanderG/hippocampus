### A Pony Cookbook

This being my first Pony program, I had a lot of false starts and problems. This documents several key stuff I learnt and may be useful to beginner Pony programmers.

At the point of this writing, there isn't a large bunch of seconddary help material (like blog posts and QAs); but that is part of the fun, reading the docs and figuring stuff out. As such, what I write here is what I posit and what I *think* is correct. It may not actually be and I'll probably have future entries correcting older ones.

If you are reading this and are an experienced Pony programmer, I'll be very thankful if you find and point out misunderstandings or incorrect stuff.
